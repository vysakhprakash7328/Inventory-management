# Inventory Management System

## Overview
This Inventory Management System is built using Django and Django REST Framework, allowing users to efficiently manage inventory items through a comprehensive API. It supports creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting items.

## Features
- **User Registration and Authentication**
- **CRUD Operations** for inventory items
- **Token-based Authentication**
- **Comprehensive API Endpoints** for easy integration

## Technologies Used
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for web application development.
- **Django REST Framework**: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **SQLite** (or PostgreSQL/MySQL depending on your configuration): A lightweight database engine.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, used for caching and messaging.
- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used to develop the application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Redis**: Ensure Redis is installed on your system. You can find installation instructions on the [Redis website](https://redis.io/download).
